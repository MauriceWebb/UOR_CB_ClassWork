JIBE

PURPOSE: Welcome to JIBE, an online application for finding a like-minded companion. Here at JIBE, we hope to improve the quality of matchmaking based on values before viewing, beliefs before beauty. Our app aims to deliver high quality matches based on an algorithm that sorts for similar responses on philosophy, morality, and spirituality, and then prioritizes results based on physical preferences. So JIBE aboard, love has never been this smoothe sailin'...
