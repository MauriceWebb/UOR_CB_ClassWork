# Todo List

* In this activity you will be implementing logic to create a simple todo list.

* When the "Add Todo" button is clicked, grab the text from the input field and use it to create and append a new `li` element to the list. Bootstrap uses the class `list-group` item for their `li` tags.

* Once you're able to add todos, implement logic to delete one random todo from the list every 3 seconds when the "Start Todo Delete Timer" element is clicked.

* Stop the todo deleting timer when the "Stop Todo Delete Timer" element is clicked.

### Hints

* You may need to look up how to grab the value of an input field using jQuery.

### Bonus

* Clear the value of the input field after a todo is added.

* Add logic to prevent the user from adding empty todo text.

* Add buttons to each todo list item to delete that todo individually.
