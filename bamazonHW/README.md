### Welcome to my BAMazon store! Every week, we sell skin care, hair care, and bath & shower products. Just run `node bamazonCustomer` in your terminal to start the app!

The app will log into a secured database to access the data of available products. Follow the prompts to prepare and complete a purchase. After purchase, the BAMazon bot will give you the chance to make additional purchases. If you wish to exit the application, follow the prompts and the connection will terminate.
